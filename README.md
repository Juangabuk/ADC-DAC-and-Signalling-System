## 1. Signal and System
### Signal is a quantity that carry information which is changed because of time or/and space. The examples of signal around you are current or voltage in electric circuit, sound wave, and temperature. Signal divided by its dimension: one-dimension signal (1D) and multi-dimension signal (2D and 3D). One-dimension signal is a signal consisting of one independent variable, example: Audio Signal s(t). While, the multi- dimension signal is a signal consisting more than one independent variable, examples: Image (2D, f(x,y)) and Video (3D). 
## 1.1.1 Various Signal 
### a. Continuous time signal and discrete time signal
Continuous Signal is a signal that defined for every numbers at time-axis (t), which (t) is a real number and the amplitude also real. While, Discrete Signal is a signal that defined ONLY for discrete number (n), where n is an integer and the amplitude is real number.
### b. Analog Signal and Digital Signal
Analog Signal is a Data Signal in a Continuous waveform, that carry information by changing the characteristic of the wave. Digital Signal is pulse Data Signal that can suddenly change and have a magnitude of 0 and 1, so it is not easily influenced by noise. Both of those signal propagate in a continuous time, ranging from 0 to in an infinite loop.
### c. Real Signal and Complex Signal
Real signal is Signals that are real for all variable. While Complex Signal is Signals that have a complex magnitude (consist of imaginer magnitude factor).
### d. Deterministic Signal and Random Signal
Deterministic signal is Signals that are the overall signal value can be determined by a mathematical equation, example: Sinusoidal Signal. While Random Signal have a random value for a given time, example: voltage noise in amplifier.
### f. Periodic Signal and Non-periodic Signal
Periodic signal is signals that are experiencing the same form on the recurrence interval of certain time.
In mathematical equation, Continuous Signal is called Periodic if only:
x(t + kT) = x(t) for -  < t < , Where k is an integer and T is the signal periode. 
In mathematical equation, Continuous Signal is called Periodic if only : x (n + kN) = x(n)  for -  < n < , Where k is an integer and T is the signal periode. 

## 1.1.2 Basic Signals 
### a.	Impulse Unit ()
Continuous Impulse Unit (t): signals that appear suddenly within the fastest duration (t=0) and the amplitude nearly to an in infinite loop, width nearby 0, and the broad = 1.
