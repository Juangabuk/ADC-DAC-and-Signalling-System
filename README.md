## 1. Signal and System
### Signal is a quantity that carry information which is changed because of time or/and space. The examples of signal around you are current or voltage in electric circuit, sound wave, and temperature. Signal divided by its dimension: one-dimension signal (1D) and multi-dimension signal (2D and 3D). One-dimension signal is a signal consisting of one independent variable, example: Audio Signal s(t). While, the multi- dimension signal is a signal consisting more than one independent variable, examples: Image (2D, f(x,y)) and Video (3D). 
## 1.1.1 Various Signal 
### a. Continuous time signal and discrete time signal
Continuous Signal is a signal that defined for every numbers at time-axis (t), which (t) is a real number and the amplitude also real. While, Discrete Signal is a signal that defined ONLY for discrete number (n), where n is an integer and the amplitude is real number.
